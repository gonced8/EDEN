    -Gender: male is represented by a 1 and female by a 0
    -Age: has the age of the being
    -Happiness: this value represents how happy said being is in a given moment of time, which is directly related to the satisfaction of its needs
    -Size: this value represents how big an individual is, 0
    -Speed: value that ranges from 0 to 255 that represents how fast a being can move, 0 being the slowest and 255 the fastest
    -Stamina: value that ranges from 0 to 255, representing how much stamina said being has
    -Aggressiveness: value that ranges from 0 to 255 showing how agressive the being is, 0 being the least and 255 the maximum
    -Perception: value that ranges from 0 to 255 informing how well the being can sense what's around him
    -Health: value that ranges from 0 to 255 saying how healthy the being is, 255 being max health
